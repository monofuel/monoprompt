## prompt

Please generate a nim file with the following function:

```
import std/[os,strformat, strutils]

proc recurseList*(filePath: string): seq[string] =
  ## Recursively list all files in a directory.
  ## returns a list of relative file paths
  ## skip hidden files
  echo &"DEBUG: recurse listing {filepath}"

```

nim has an implicit `result` variable for all functions you can use that is automatically returned.
Please skip hidden files that start with a `.`

include a `when isMainModule:` block that can test the function in the current directory.
